      <description>Today was my second attempt on the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. My initial attempt was about 6 months ago. I was in a hurry to get it over and done with and despite the fact that I did not feel ready, I went ahead and sat the exam. I found the exam to be rather tough as I do not work with AWS day in day out but despite that, I was disappointed to fail the exam by 2 or 20 points.</description>
